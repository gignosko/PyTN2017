# PyTN 2017: It's Time For Functional Programming! Maybe

This repo just holds my PyTN 2017 Jupyter Notebook and slides in markdown form. 

If you're interested, use  [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) to see my slides

The notebook is just code snippets to show some of the concepts in the talk. Moving from top to bottom _should_ follow the slides.
