# Bringing Functional Programming into an Imperative World.
# Maybe

----

# Why FP?

* Expressive
* Efficient
* Safe-er
* Easier to work with concurrent programming

Note: Let's look at the pillars of functional programming

---

# Higher order functions
* Functions can be passed around just like any other value

----

# Immutable data structures
* The structure itself never gets changed
* New way of thinking about "updating" your data structure
    * every update returns a new data structure
* Safety
    * since each update returns a new data structure, you can safely pass them around
* Historically inefficient, but that's changing

Note: persistent data structures are gaining traction and they have logic to be much more efficient.

----

# Recursion
* Calling a function from inside itself. 

* Recursion takes the place of loops in many functional languages

* Every time you call, you add to the stack

* Tail call optimizations eliminate this if you design your function properly


----

# Pure functions
* No side effects
* Idempotent
* Tend to be small

Note: Idempotence means you get the same results every time you pass in the same parameters. 

Small functions are cleaner and easier to understand

Small funtions also favor reuse. 

----

# Function Composition
* Combine functions just like you would in math
* The result of one function is passed in as the parameter to the next
* f(g(x))
* get_users_over_18(get_all_users()) 

----

# Map, Reduce, Filter
* Map - Apply the same function to every item in a collection
* Reduce - Apply a function to every item in a collection, gathering the results in one final variable
* Filter - Apply a function to every item in a collection, resulting in a new "filtered" collection
* Lambdas - anonymous, unnamed functions

---

## Python is 
# NOT
## a functional language

---

# Why FP in Python
* Python has most of what we need for FP
    * Functions are first class citizens
    * Ways of working with immutable data
    * Map, filter, reduce are built in
    * lambdas

Note: 
1. To get a lot of the benefits of FP, we needs functions to be first class citizens, which they are in python. 

This means you can pass functions as parameters and return them as results

2. There are some built in immutable data structures such as tuples and frozensets

We'll also look at other ways to work with list that mimic immutability

---




# Immutable data structures
* Tuples
* Strings
* Numeric types
* frozen sets
* bytes

Note:
tuple - like an immutable list. Usually used for heterogeneous data. 

Did you know strings are immutable?

frozenset - immutable set, unordered collection. the contents cannot be changed. Sets have certain mathematical properties that are useful. 



----

# Working with immutable data
1. deepcopy()
2. comprehensions

Note: deepcopy will make a complete copy of the items in the collection. This can be inefficient in both time and memory.
That's the price you sometimes pay for safety
Using comprehensions is more efficient if you're already going to iterate over the whole list to make changes

---

# Recursion in python

* Every time you recursively call a function, you add to the stack
* Tail call optimization eliminates adding to stack if your function is in the tail position
* But...python doesn't have tail call optimization
    * there are ways to eliminate tail calls from the stack, but they are not as elegant.

---

# Map, filter, reduce and lambdas

----

# Lambdas
* Anonymous functions are functions without a name

        lambda x, y: x + y

----

* In python 2, all three produce lists. 
* In python 3, map and filter return iterators
    * You can get a list by wrapping your call to map/filter in list(...)

---

# So, should you write more functional code in python?

----

# Maybe

----

* Functional code can be safer
* Functional code can be less verbose
* Functional code can be cleaner

----

* Functional code looks different, it's not always "pythonic"
* Functional code is not immediately understandable, it "thinks different"
* Functional code isn't always efficient in python
